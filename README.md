# ExoQuest Platform

*A machine learningâ€“based platform for exoplanet detection and analysis*
*Developed for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025*

---

## Project Overview

**ExoQuest Platform** is an integrated system for exoplanet detection and analysis.
It combines data from NASAâ€™s **Kepler**, **K2**, and **TESS** missions with machine learning and modern visualization tools to support both scientific research and public engagement.

The platform enables users to upload, visualize, and classify light-curve or tabular data, view interpretability results, and export reproducible analyses.
Its dual-mode designâ€”**Explore Mode** and **Research Mode**â€”caters to both learners and professional researchers.

---

## Platform Highlights

* Automated detection of planetary transits using supervised learning models
* Interactive visualization of light-curve and feature data
* Explainable results with feature-importance analysis
* Support for multi-mission datasets (Kepler, K2, TESS)
* Batch analysis and configurable decision thresholds
* Web-based, containerized architecture for reproducible deployment
